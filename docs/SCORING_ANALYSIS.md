# Tetris Scoring System Analysis

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Current Scoring Values (from config.rs)
```rust
SCORE_SINGLE_LINE: 100
SCORE_DOUBLE_LINE: 300
SCORE_TRIPLE_LINE: 500
SCORE_TETRIS: 800
SCORE_SOFT_DROP: 1 (per cell)
SCORE_HARD_DROP: 2 (per cell)
```

### Current Scoring Logic
- **Line Clear**: Base score × Level
- **Soft Drop**: 1 point per cell descended
- **Hard Drop**: 2 points per cell dropped
- **Level Multiplier**: Linear multiplication by current level

### Missing Features
- ❌ T-spin bonuses (T-spin Single, Double, Triple)
- ❌ Combo system for consecutive line clears
- ❌ Back-to-back bonuses (consecutive Tetris/T-spins)
- ❌ Perfect Clear bonuses
- ❌ Mini T-spin vs Full T-spin differentiation
- ❌ All Clear (Perfect Clear) detection and bonus

## Authentic Tetris Scoring Standards

### Official Tetris Guideline Scoring (Modern Standard)

#### Basic Line Clear Scoring
```
Single: 100 × level
Double: 300 × level  
Triple: 500 × level
Tetris: 800 × level
```
✅ **Current implementation matches this!**

#### T-spin Scoring
```
T-spin Mini Single: 200 × level
T-spin Single: 800 × level
T-spin Mini Double: 400 × level (rare)
T-spin Double: 1200 × level
T-spin Triple: 1600 × level
```

#### Combo System
- **Combo formula**: For combo count > 0: 50 × combo × level
- **Combo increments** on consecutive line clears
- **Combo resets** when no lines are cleared

#### Back-to-Back Bonus
- **Applies to**: Tetris, T-spin Single, T-spin Double, T-spin Triple
- **Bonus**: 1.5× multiplier when performed consecutively
- **Example**: Back-to-back Tetris = 800 × level × 1.5 = 1200 × level

#### Perfect Clear (All Clear) Bonus
```
Single Perfect Clear: 800 × level
Double Perfect Clear: 1200 × level
Triple Perfect Clear: 1800 × level
Tetris Perfect Clear: 2000 × level
```

#### Soft Drop & Hard Drop
```
Soft Drop: 1 point per cell (matches current)
Hard Drop: 2 points per cell (matches current)
```

### Classic Nintendo Tetris (NES) Scoring

#### Line Clear Scoring
```
Single: 40 × (level + 1)
Double: 100 × (level + 1)
Triple: 300 × (level + 1)
Tetris: 1200 × (level + 1)
```

#### Additional Features
- No T-spins (SRS didn't exist)
- No combo system
- Different level progression

## Comparison Summary

### What We're Missing
1. **T-spin Scoring System** - Major scoring feature
2. **Combo System** - Rewards consecutive clears
3. **Back-to-Back Bonuses** - Multipliers for skill moves
4. **Perfect Clear Detection** - All clear bonuses
5. **T-spin Type Detection** - Mini vs Full T-spins

### What We Have Right
1. ✅ Basic line clear values match modern Guideline
2. ✅ Level multiplier system
3. ✅ Soft/Hard drop scoring
4. ✅ Level progression structure

## Recommendation

**Implement Modern Tetris Guideline Scoring** because:
- We already have SRS rotation system
- T-spin detection is partially implemented
- Matches competitive/tournament standards
- More feature-rich and engaging
- Compatible with our existing SRS system

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Enhanced Scoring Structure
1. Create comprehensive scoring enum/module
2. Add T-spin bonus calculations
3. Implement combo system

### Phase 2: Advanced Features  
1. Back-to-back bonus tracking
2. Perfect clear detection
3. Mini vs Full T-spin differentiation

### Phase 3: Integration
1. Connect with SRS T-spin detection
2. Update UI to show scoring details
3. Add scoring notifications/animations

This will transform the game from basic line-clear scoring to a fully-featured modern Tetris scoring system that rewards advanced techniques and skill.
