# Floating Block Bug Fix - Test Scenarios

## Summary of Fix

The floating block bug has been fixed by implementing multiple safeguards:

1. **Fixed horizontal movement logic**: Grounded pieces no longer reset lock delay when moving horizontally
2. **Added maximum piece lifetime**: Pieces are force-locked after 10 seconds to prevent infinite floating
3. **Improved lock delay management**: Better tracking of when pieces should be locked

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Lock Delay Logic (src/game/state.rs:331-370)
- Horizontal movement of grounded pieces no longer resets the lock delay timer
- Only pieces that can still fall after horizontal movement get lock delay reset
- This prevents the infinite horizontal sliding that caused floating pieces

### 2. Maximum Piece Lifetime Safeguard (src/game/config.rs:24)
- Added `MAX_PIECE_LIFETIME` constant set to 10.0 seconds
- Force-locks any piece that exceeds this time limit
- Critical fail-safe against any remaining floating scenarios

### 3. Enhanced Update Logic (src/game/state.rs:195-201)
- Added lifetime timer tracking for current piece
- Force-lock check runs before normal lock delay logic
- Provides logged warning when force-lock occurs

## Test Scenarios to Verify Fix

### Scenario 1: Rapid Horizontal Movement
**Steps:**
1. Drop a piece until it lands on the ground
2. Rapidly move left and right continuously 
3. **Expected Result:** Piece locks after normal lock delay (~0.3s), not floating indefinitely

### Scenario 2: Horizontal Movement + Rotation
**Steps:**
1. Get a piece to ground level
2. Alternate between horizontal movement and rotation attempts
3. **Expected Result:** Piece locks within lock delay period, no floating

### Scenario 3: Soft Drop + Horizontal Sliding
**Steps:**
1. Use soft drop to get piece to ground quickly
2. Immediately start horizontal movement
3. **Expected Result:** Piece locks normally, no floating behavior

### Scenario 4: Maximum Lifetime Force-Lock
**Steps:**
1. Use techniques that previously caused floating
2. Keep piece "floating" for over 10 seconds
3. **Expected Result:** Piece force-locks with warning message in logs

### Scenario 5: Complex Movement Patterns
**Steps:**
1. Try rapid combinations of rotation + horizontal movement
2. Test with different piece types (I, T, L, etc.)
3. **Expected Result:** All pieces lock properly, no floating

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Compile and run the game
cd /home/xenocide/rust-projects/rust-tetris-agent1
cargo run

# Try the test scenarios above
# Look for this log message if testing maximum lifetime:
# "Piece exceeded maximum lifetime of 10s, force-locking to prevent floating bug"
```

## Technical Details

The fix addresses the root cause by:
- Preventing lock delay reset on horizontal movement of grounded pieces
- Adding a maximum lifetime failsafe (10 seconds per piece)
- Maintaining proper lock state management
- Preserving normal gameplay feel for legitimate movements

This ensures that pieces will always eventually lock, preventing the floating block bug while maintaining responsive controls.
